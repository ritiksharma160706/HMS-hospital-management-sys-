# HMS-hospital-management-system
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a computerized platform designed to efficiently manage the day-to-day operations of a hospital. It helps in maintaining patient records, doctor schedules, staff details, billing, pharmacy information, and laboratory data in a digital and organized form.

This system reduces paperwork, minimizes human error, and saves time by automating key hospital functions such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, report generation, and inventory control.

By integrating all departments — administration, medical, financial, and support — the HMS ensures smooth communication, better decision-making, and improved healthcare service quality.
